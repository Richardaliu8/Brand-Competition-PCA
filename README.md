# Brand-Competition-PCA

Project Overview  
This project leverages Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Principal Components Regression (PCR) to analyze and visualize the competitive landscape of car brands, with a focus on the client's brand, Infinity. The analysis aims to uncover underlying factors that influence consumer preferences and competitive positioning among various car brands.

Features  
Brand Maps Creation: Constructs visual brand maps using PCA, enabling a clear depiction of how brands compete and are perceived in the market.  
Factor Analysis: Identifies and retains significant factors influencing brand perception. Four factors were retained based on eigenvalues greater than 1, enhancing the interpretability of consumer preferences.  
Iso-preference and Ideal Vector Explanation: Provides insights into iso-preference lines and ideal vectors, illustrating directions of increasing consumer preference and brand positioning relative to market ideals.  
Statistical Analysis: Employs data bootstrap methods to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the angle of the ideal vector, ensuring robustness in directional estimates.  
Strategic Recommendations: Offers actionable recommendations for Infinity to enhance product design and align more closely with consumer preferences, based on quantitative analysis.

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to utilize advanced statistical tools to provide strategic insights into car brand competition. By analyzing factors that drive consumer preferences, the project helps Infinity understand its position in the market and guides potential product design improvements to enhance competitive advantage.
